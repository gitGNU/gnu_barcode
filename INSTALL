The package includes both a library and a standalone program.
To install everything try

	./configure && make && make install

To uninstall, try

	make uninstall

You may have problems compiling the package on non-GNUish systems,
because the tool currently uses both gmake and gawk features, and I have
no access to non-gnu systems. If your operating system isn't able to
compile barcode and you are willing to help porting, feel free to call me.
