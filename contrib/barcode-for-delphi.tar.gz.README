The barcode-for-delphi tarball includes a version of this package
ported to run under Delphi. Please note that you can't distribute the
executable because of the GPL (i.e., disitributing it would be
copyright violation, because the executable is a derived work of GNU
barcode, whose authors don't allow distributing under non-GPL terms.

I still think it may be useful to some users.
