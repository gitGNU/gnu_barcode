This is GNU-barcode.

The package is meant to solve most needs in barcode creation with a
conventional printer. It can create printouts for the conventional
product-ta gging standards: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN. Ouput
is generated as either Postscript or Encapsulated Postscript (other
back-ends may be added if needed).

The package is released as both a library and a command-line frontend,
so that you can include barcode-generation into your application.  The
program is released in the hope that is proves useful but without any
warranty, according to the GPL Licence (see ./COPYING).

Please take the "no-warranty" disclaimer seriously: even though I
spent reasonable efforts to make sure the output is useable in
production you should verify it suits your needs as a faulty bar can
cost you a bundle, and you'll be on your own. It's up to you to verify
that the symbol is valid (and, obviously, I'd like to know about any
problem you encounter).

If you need to print a "real" ISBN symbol, you might try to get
"bookland.py" by Judah Milgram (http://www.cgpp.com/bookland/). While
my main target is flexibility his main target is strict adherence to
the standards. Bookland is free software and will probabily be
included in the GNU project.

I would like to thank both Judah Milgram and Michele Comitini
(mcm@glisco.it) for their help with this tool
