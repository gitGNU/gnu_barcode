Possible enhancements that I'd like to add

* verbose mode, printing position information to stderr

* code 128 (a) support

	The code can represent ascii 0-96 (control chars, no lowercase)

* shrink the bars to account for ink spreading

	Currently, small barcodes don't get rendered well. While
	version 0.91 subtracts 0.15 points from the size of the bars
	(I found that this makes good results for small bars), a smart
	alghorithm to shrink the bars is needed to get lighter prints
	at small sizes without loosing readability.

* document the intermediate representation in the real docs (instead of ps.c)

* document how a new encoding standard can be added

* include the debian/ directory by Jim Westveer as soon as it is ready for prime time
