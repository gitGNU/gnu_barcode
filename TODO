Possible enhancements that I'd like to add

* code 128 (a/b) support

	The code can represent the whole ascii charset

* code 128c support

	A digit-only code using code-128 symbols (two digits per
	symbol).  Using a mixed 128A-B and 128C will enter this
	wish-list after both of them are implemented as standalone
	backends.

* shrink the bars to account for ink spreading

	Currently, small barcodes don't get rendered well. While
	version 0.91 subtracts 0.15 points from the size of the bars
	(I found that this makes good results for small bars), a smart
	alghorithm to shrink the bars is needed to get lighter prints
	at small sizes without loosing readability.

* support millimeters, centimeters, inches

	Using "points" as a measure is definitely inpractical

* use autoconf instead of the dirty Makefile tricks

* document the intermediate representation in the real docs (instead of ps.c)

* document how a new encoding standard can be added

* allow the ``barcode'' executable to read a cfg file.

	This would allow creating descriptions of barcode output that
	 exploit all the implemented features, but I'm not sure it is useful.

* should make Debian package (paci@prosa.it is working on it)
